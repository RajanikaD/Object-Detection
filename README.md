# Object-Detection
This project performs object detection on shelf images using OpenCV and a pre-trained YOLOv3 model. It detects common objects (e.g., bottles, books) and displays bounding boxes with labels. The model is based on the COCO dataset, and the output image with detections is saved for further analysis or display.
